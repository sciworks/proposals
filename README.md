## Sciworks Proposals

**‚≠êÔ∏è Welcome to Sciworks Proposals! ‚≠êÔ∏è**

We are an open source group focused on Scientific & distributed applications.
We have a lot of ideas, and this repository is where we put soe of them.
It is a collaborative working space and incubator.

1. Add a draft proposal to [docs/_proposals/drafts](docs/_proposals/drafts) and open a pull request.
2. We can discuss your proposal, and merge when it's ready!
3. Images should go into [docs/assets/img/proposals/](docs/assets/img/proposals/)
4. Proposals will be moved into the [graduated](docs/_proposals/graduated) folder when they are done being worked on! üéâÔ∏è
